# 🎐 The short answer

A few days ago, a friend asked me this question after listening to my playing:

> *“Is the hitoyogiri that hard to play? Some of your notes sounded a bit off...is it normal?”*

A precious — and inspiring — remark that made me want to write this article.

To answer it clearly, I’d like to break the question into two parts:

1. Is it difficult to play “in tune” on a hitoyogiri?  
2. And even if it’s played well… why does it *still* sound “off”?


## 🎯 1. Is it hard to play in tune?

### 📷 Recorder vs Hitoyogiri: a simple image to understand

Imagine you're trying to capture a landscape.

- With a **recorder**, it’s like using a camera in auto mode: you frame the shot, press the button, *click*, and the picture is sharp. On the recorder, all you need to do is cover the right holes, and the note comes out clean, well-pitched — “guaranteed.”
- With a **hitoyogiri** (or a shakuhachi), you’re painting that same landscape by hand, with a brush. You have to choose the angle, the pressure, the thickness of each stroke. In flute terms: every note must be *shaped* — with your breath, your lips, your fingers, your posture. There’s no automatic note — every sound is "handmade".


### 🌬 A Matter of Mouthpiece

- A recorder has a **built-in fipple** — like a wind tunnel that channels your breath in a precise way. The instrument handles the basic tone production for you.
- The **hitoyogiri has no fipple**. You blow across a sharp edge, like blowing across the rim of a bottle. A slight change in angle, air pressure, or lip tension can shift the note — sometimes by a quarter tone.

> 🎵 In short: the **modern ear craves fixed points**. The hitoyogiri offers a **shifting landscape**.


### 🎭 The Beauty of Unstable Sound

The hitoyogiri **forgives nothing**. A breath too strong, lips too tight, a slightly wrong angle… and the sound slips away, or veers sharply.

And yet, that’s exactly what draws me to it.  
In that instability, a kind of *truthful* expression emerges.

> In a way, I’m not trying to play “perfectly in tune” —  
> I’m trying to meet the moment as it is, fluid and alive.  
> …perfectly imperfect.


👉 *But the story doesn’t end there... Because beyond this natural instability,[the hitoyogiri hides another layer of complexity — which I’ll explore with you next](/sounds-off-part2/)*
