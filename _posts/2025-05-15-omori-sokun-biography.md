I'm back, and if you're wondering what odd treasure the mad flute hermit has hauled out of their bundle this time, you'd be right to ask! <br> 
Today, I bring you a story. 
Or rather the tale of a life: the life of a master whose voice still echoes in the notes of a nearly-forgotten instrument : the hitoyogiri. <br>
*“A...what? But aren't you all about the shakuhachi?”* <br>

Oh, I am. But I also play the *hitoyogiri* - the ancestor of the *Fuke shakuhachi*.
In fact, before the Fuke shakuhachi adopted the name for itself, the instrument we now call hitoyogiri was widely known simply as “shakuhachi.”

I can already see a few puzzled faces out there. <br>
Don't worry, we'll clear that up soon. <br>
Come along!

## Chasing Sokun

Maybe it all began with the name : Omori Sokun, appearing again and again in my hitoyogiri lesson book.
From playing the music of his school to reading his words, I started to picture the hand that, four hundred years ago, shaped the characters I now try to animate with breath.

Truth be told, I suspect Ōmori Sōkun might be lingering at the edge of worlds - ear attuned, alert to the faintest trace of interest for his beloved flute. 
Or perhaps he’s searching someone -anyone- curious enough to wonder who he was—beyond the manuscripts he spent so many years writing.
If so, maybe parts of me felt that tremor in the fabric of reality. <br>
Something stirred. <br>
A space opened -just wide enough for a ghostly suggestion to seep in.
 
Despite the 400 years that separate us, I set myself the challenge of reaching back through time to make his acquaintance.

Lacking a machine to catapult me into the 16th century, I gathered the information I had from class, then set off digging (thank you, Internet, labyrinth of knowledge) to piece together the story of his life.
At the end of a long day hunched over my computer, I emerged from my den hungry, dehydrated… and triumphant—like an archaeologist waving a shard of pottery from a forgotten civilization.

A character was finally beginning to emerge from between the lines, and with him, the outline of a fascinating journey.
It took a few more days to put all that into… music -pun very much intended. <br>
The computer overheated, my brain did too. <br>
And here we are.

This article is a work in progress: I keep refining it as I find more information.
My sources are listed at the bottom of this article, and you’ll see that they sometimes contradict one another (for instance, about how Sōkun’s ancestor may or may not have dispatched Masashige). In such cases, I prefer to let a bit of artistic blur remain rather than risk passing on misinformation.
And when I mention “the sources,” I don’t mean that in some prophetic or all-knowing sense —after so much cross-checking and note-cutting, I honestly lost track of who said what. So everything’s down at the bottom, and if you feel like playing detective, you’re more than welcome to match each detail to its original author.

If, by any chance, you know more about the life of Ōmori Sōkun —if you spot an error in what I’ve written, or (dare I dream?) if you happen to own a secret manuscript detailing the finer points of his daily life— I’d be delighted to correct any slip-ups that found their way in. And absolutely ecstatic to learn more about this figure I’ve spent so many hours trying to bring back to life.

Ready? Let’s go.

Buckle up—we’re taking off. Destination: Japan.
But not the Japan of travel brochures.
We’re heading to 1582. The Sengoku period is in full swing, and it can be summed up in two words: *feudal chaos*.

Nobunaga, the daimyō (warlord) of the Oda clan—nicknamed “the Demon King” for his ruthless military campaigns—has just died.

Without getting lost in the details, let’s just say he was more than a fearsome commander. Visionary strategist and shrewd businessman, his legacy runs deeper than it seems.
And his death didn’t just rattle the nation —it shifted the course of Ōmori Sōkun's story, too.

But before we get to that, let’s rewind a little.

## Kyōto, 1570.

We’re at the dawn of the 17th century. Japan is just beginning to emerge from the turmoil of civil war.
Look closely. Amid the power struggles and feudal ambitions, a figure is starting to stand out.

Let’s get closer.
There he is.
Or rather—there’s the boy we’re looking for.

His name is He Shinkurō, sometimes written Shinjurō.
A samurai in the making.
A mind tuned to tactics.
A musician with a growing voice.

But he’s not yet the Ōmori Sōkun that history will remember.

Born on March 15, 1570, in Kyōto, into a modest family of warrior lineage, Shinkurō grew up in the shadow of a famous ancestor: Ōmori Hikoshichi.
Legend has it that Hikoshichi once crossed blades with the legendary Kusunoki Masashige —a symbol of unwavering samurai loyalty.
The weight of his bloodline hangs over Shinkuro like a distant drumbeat —felt more than heard— as the young flutist begins to find his path.

![image-center]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2025-05-15-masashige.webp){: .align-center}
*Kusunoki Masashige (楠正成) - by Utagawa Kuniyoshi, 1843–44. Woodblock print (oban tate-e). British Museum (Accession no. 2008,3037.15307). Public domain.*

While this historical stew bubbles away, Shinkurō —the future Sōkun— is already showing a remarkable gift for music.
His instrument of choice is the hitoyogiri, which he studies under the guidance of several monks, most notably at the temple of Myōken-ji.
At the same time, he receives a Zen Buddhist training from Tenshuku Sōgan, a Rinzai master, at another temple you can still visit today: Daitoku-ji.

In this way, Shinkurō builds a rich foundation: a rigorous musical education, a spiritual grounding in Zen, and the martial legacy of his samurai lineage, which would eventually turn rōnin (masterless warriors) after the Ōnin War.

A solid résumé for the era - one that gets him a place in the military.
He enters the service of Oda Nobunaga, likely as a page or young vassal.

But the war drums beat the tempo of history, and in 1582, everything falls apart.
The head of the Oda clan loses his life in the Incident at Honnō-ji.

Shinkurō is only twelve years old.
Suddenly, he finds himself without a lord, without a job —and at a decisive crossroads.

Instead of pursuing a military or administrative career under another warlord, he chooses… retreat.

A radical career move, let’s be honest.
Why? I wish I knew. 
All we know is that he withdraws from the world to become a hermit.

Far from swords and arquebuses (yes, 16th-century Japan already had firearms), Shinkurō retreats to the hills above Kyōto, away from the noise and chaos of the city.

It’s easy to picture him there —frozen in meditation at the mouth of a cave, grumbling whenever a passerby gets too close.

A caricature, of course —nowhere near the truth.

Granted, Sokun does spend the early years of his new life in seclusion.
His lifestyle is austere. He becomes a secular hermit (koji)—that is, he doesn’t join any official Buddhist order, but rigorously follows the Zen practices he learned in his youth.

He even adopts a new name: *Shuan*, meaning “Hermitage on the Mountain Peak.”
Just in case there was any doubt about the nature of his retreat.

During his excursions into bustling Kyōto, Sokun crosses paths with monks from every school —Shingon, Tendai, Nichiren…
They talk, they meditate, they play music -trading thoughts on spirit and sound alike.

Music lies at the very heart of our hermit’s concerns.
More precisely: the *hitoyogiri*, that small bamboo flute that has accompanied him since childhood.

Sokun devotes himself to it, body and soul.
He copies old pieces by hand, adapts contemporary melodies, and tries to preserve everything...before it’s too late.

The problem? the flute that gives rhythm to his days has fallen out of favor in the city.
Urban audiences now prefer a shiny new instrument fresh from the Fuke tradition.

And yet, for nearly three centuries, the hitoyogiri has been the instrument of choice for samurai and scholars alike.
Its fall from grace is easy enough to explain: a limited range —an octave and a half at best— and a modest volume that struggles to stand out against the koto or shamisen played by the “guitar heroes” of the late 16th century.

By contrast, the Fuke-style shakuhachi arrives with a bang —boasting a whopping three scales, deeper tones, greater resonance, and a voice that suits the new age.

But Sokun isn’t giving up.
He’s convinced the two instruments can coexist —and he intends to prove it.

By the age of twenty-two, Sokun’s skill with the hitoyogiri is known throughout the region.
His growing reputation opens the doors of literary salons and tea pavilions, where audiences savor his performances between poetry readings and philosophical debates.

Despite his austere lifestyle, Sokun seems perfectly at ease amid this intellectual buzz.
He forms close ties with state officials, high-ranking samurai—and even the governor of Kyōto.
It’s said he travels on horseback in their company: a clear sign of his proximity to the elite of his time.

And, as every great ascent demands the proper decorum (this is Japan, after all), Sokun begins to refine his public identity.
In his forties, he formally settles on *Sokun*: the "kun" (勲) in "Omori Sokun" is an honorary title indicating his service to the emperor - but we'll get to that), while continuing to use *Shuan* for his artistic endeavors.

*His inner circle probably ended up inventing a nickname of their own—something permanent—just to avoid the whole naming headache.*

## The birth of a school

Legend has it that, at the dawn of the 16th century, a mysterious stranger appeared and taught the art of the hitoyogiri to an aging master named Sosa.
In time, Sosa founded a school bearing his name and passed on his knowledge to a select group of disciples.

Among them —or perhaps later— Sokun inherited this legacy. 
He would go on to build upon the foundations laid by the Sosa-ryū (“Sosa school”), refining and expanding the tradition.

Our story now brings us to this very moment, around the year 1600, when Sokun is now widely recognized as a master of the hitoyogiri, drawing students from far and wide who seek to study under his guidance..

Yet, the instrument itself is modest. Almost ordinary.
Today, it might well be lumped in with the humble recorder—(*which would be unfair to a truly charming instrument—shoutout to my fellow recorder players; I played for a good decade myself*).
But the moment you hold one, its complexity becomes clear.

Not only is it steeped in Taoist thought, it also demands a particular kind of mastery:
Each note must be adjusted “by mouth,” according to not one but five distinct musical scales, each one tied to a season, just like in gagaku, the music of the imperial court.

I’ll be devoting at least one full article to this subject… or, knowing me, several.
The cultural context surrounding the hitoyogiri is just too fascinating not to explore at length. <br>
*(Anticipative sigh.)*

Sokun primarily teaches using one of five musical modes: Oshiki, associated with summer and a specific flute length—because hitoyogiri flutes come in five distinct lengths.
And that detail matters.

From his hermitage, Sokun doesn’t just commit oral tradition to paper—he also crafts the flutes used in his school.
According to legend, they’re of exceptional quality.

Meanwhile, he reads the Chinese classics, meditates, and continues to study… military strategy.
In fact, he eventually weaves the two together into a kind of unified theory where music and tactics speak to one another—like a kind of sonic oracle.

In short, Ōmori Sōkun keeps himself busy.

And yet, amid an already demanding life, Sokun stays true to the inner call that shaped his path so far: to save the hitoyogiri from the silence of oblivion.

To do so, he adapts contemporary pieces to suit the tastes of his time, while also taking care to preserve older compositions—called "te" —whose transmission is beginning to fray dangerously as the old masters fade away.

Slow, meditative, and wordless, These pieces follow the rhythm of the seasons, attuning the spirit to the ceaseless movement of yin-yang.

Perhaps they are —though this remains only a hypothesis— the ancestors of honkyoku, the meditative pieces later played on the shakuhachi of the Fuke school.

In 1608, Sokun distills the fruit of his labor into a single manuscript: the Tanteki Hidenfu (“Secret Notes of the Little Flute”).
Unknowingly, he commits to paper the earliest known written record of music for the hitoyogiri.

From an ethnomusicological perspective, this book brings together two opposite worlds.

On one side, *Yoshinoyama* —a hit of the Edo period— emerges as a signature piece of the repertoire.
As hitoyogiri music seeps into tea pavilions and scholars’ gardens, this melody becomes a muse for countless poems celebrating cherry blossoms and their swirling petals —still dazzling us today.

At the other end of the spectrum, pieces like *Tsushima*, drawn from samurai and monastic traditions, bring a meditative depth that balances the lighter, lilting tunes.

This careful interplay between entertainment and introspection fuels the school’s appeal:
the lively pieces captivate beginners from all walks of life, while the contemplative works speak to the deeper demands of a spiritual path.

*Cherry Blossoms at Yoshino _By Katsushika Hokusai, ca. 1833._ Woodblock print; ink and color on paper. The Metropolitan Museum of Art (Accession no. JP2923). Public Domain.*

The following year, he composes a new treatise: the *Ritsuryō Bintōshō* —a scholarly text on the twelve Chinese tones, in which he weaves together music, cosmology, tuning systems… and something that looks a little like what you would find in the YiJing.

It's hard to say exactly what he was aiming for. *I* like to call it his “unified theory.”
But that’s another story, for another article.

Oh—one more thing worth mentioning:

At the time, Sokun’s writings weren’t *printed*.
He wrote them out by hand—carefully, patiently —for his students.
And those students, in turn, passed the booklets from hand to hand, like fragile treasures.

Which means that today, more than four centuries later, we can still read the notes traced by Sokun himself.

Personally, I find that… well —completely bonkers.
The good kind of bonkers.
The kind that makes your heart wobble and your eyes go a bit funny.

## Sokun's writings

Here’s a list of the surviving works attributed to Sokun.
Not all of them have been digitised yet, and consulting them often means visiting libraries like Yōmei Bunko in Kyōto or Geijutsu Daigaku in Tōkyō.

- Tanteki Hidenfu (Secret Notes of the Little Flute, 1608): the earliest known text on the hitoyogiri—a true bible!Preserved at the Miyagi Michio Memorial Museum.
- Sosa-ryū Shakuhachi Tesu narabini Shoka Mokuroku (1622): outlines the pieces and fingering systems specific to each piece (not each note—a unique feature of the hitoyogiri, which I’ll return to in another post).
- Shakuhachi Hiden-roku (Secret Records of the Shakuhachi, 1623): little information is available about this manuscript—most likely a collection of oral teachings intended for advanced students.
- Shakuhachi Tekasu Mokuroku (1624): a catalogue of pieces for shakuhachi; a signed copy in Sokun’s own hand survives in a private collection known as Fushin’an Bunko.
- Shakuhachi Sōden-shū (1624): a transmission anthology, considered a compendium of lineage knowledge.


In the final years of his life, Sokun enters a kind of writing frenzy: his last known texts date from 1624, and he passes away the following year.
In total, he commits no fewer than 70 musical pieces to paper, organised according to the five chōshi (the four seasons, plus the interseason).

Thanks to him, the hitoyogiri broke free from its oral roots to become a written legend —ready to carry its breath across the centuries, unbroken.

## The legacy of a Superstar Hermit

Sokun’s music eventually reaches the imperial court and catches the ear of Emperor Goyōzei.
We are around the year 1605.

Intrigued by this unusual hermit and his outdated flute —now revived with uncommon zeal— the emperor invites him to court to hear him play.

Clearly, Goyōzei was impressed: he commissions five flutes from Sokun, each crafted for one of the five modes mentioned earlier.

This imperial gesture adds to Sokun’s growing reputation.
Believe it or not, one of those very flutes has since entered legend.
The emperor, charmed by its ethereal tone, lightly brushed a calligraphy onto its slender bamboo body: *reion* —spiritual tone.

Insignificant little flute player that I am, I must say… *I couldn’t agree more*.

Actually, a few flutes made by Ōmori Sōkun have survived the centuries and reached us.
One is held at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, while two others are on display at the Tokugawa Art Museum in Nagoya, Japan.

Meanwhile, the Sosa-ryū school experiences a meteoric rise.
The sound of the hitoyogiri resonates across all levels of society —from monasteries to tea pavilions.
Sokun gains prestigious patronage, and his influence soon reaches the inner circle of Tokugawa Ieyasu himself —shogun, and de facto ruler of Japan.

For instance,the tea ceremony master Kobori Enshū (Masakazu) commissions a flute from him, one he named "White Rain".

Even the monk-poet Ikkyū, known for his sharp wit and wild spirit, is said to have fallen under the spell of the little flute.
It’s even whispered that Sokun may have taught the hitoyogiri to Tokugawa Ieyasu —or Oda Nobunaga himself (though that would have been at a rather tender age… *doubtful rise of left eyebrow*).

If true, it would suggest that Sokun was already a remarkable player in his youth.
And from an ethnomusicological perspective, it would support the idea that samurai carried their hitoyogiri with them on military campaigns.

*…But let’s not get carried away.*
I do have a few doubts about Nobunaga picking out a small page playing the flute in the middle of his army.


Other key figures crossed his path—and if you happen to be a bit of a shakuhachi nerd (I am too *—and I mean that as the highest compliment*), a few of these names might ring a bell:
- Nakamura Sōzan (or Soza): published the Shichiku Shoshin-shū in 1664, one of the first printed manuals for hitoyogiri (not to be confused with the later work by Juntei in the 18th century, which bears the same title).
- Murata Sōsei: compiled a collection of pieces in 1669, the Dōshokyoku, published in Kyōto—a sign that the Sosa-ryū tradition was still very much alive in the Kansai region during the 17th century.
- Sashida Ichion (“Shida”): an active performer in Edo (Tokyo), and founder of the Sashida-ryū school.
- Hara Zesai (†1669): shakuhachi player, flute maker, and self-declared heir to the Sosa-ryū lineage. <br>
And closer to us :
- Inoue Shunzui: a scholar and passionate advocate for the hitoyogiri during the 19th Century, even though by this time, the little flute was already extinct.

## Twilight of a soul, rebirth of an Art

From everything I’ve read so far —and perhaps this is part of why I feel so drawn to him— Sokun, despite his prestigious connections, always chose to return to the moss-covered stones of his hermitage, rather than surrender to the splendour and luxury of a city life he had more than earned.

Unlike other masters of his time, he sought neither a post at a grand temple nor a position within the shogunal administration.

Nonetheless, he was awarded the honorary title of *Hokkyo* —Bridge of the Dharma— likely in recognition of his artistic mastery rather than any formal religious standing.
"Bridge of the Dharma" was a title traditionally given to lay artists whose work was seen as a conduit for Buddhist values, even if they weren’t ordained.

Everything in Sokun's life points to a man who chose freedom over hierarchy.

To the very end, Sokun continued to carefully record the oral tradition of the hitoyogiri—perhaps driven by a quiet urgency, a shadow of knowing...
A dark intuition, maybe.

In the spring of 1625, he left his hermitage to accept an invitation from Lord Hori Naogori.
But along the journey, his health began to falter.
He never made it back.

Sokun died on April 10th, in the town of Murakami, in the province of Echigo.
He was fifty-six years old.

Some say he had made preparations before leaving, as if he knew he might not return.

His school lived on for a time, carried forward by two of his disciples.
Their writings have reached us.

Yamamoto Mantsu wrote of them, in 1813:

“The first Sokun (Ōmori) was a master. The one in the middle had many talents. The last… was not so gifted.
But both were essential to the development of the hitoyogiri.”

The winds shifted.

The shakuhachi of the Fuke school —more modern, more adaptable— eventually eclipsed the hitoyogiri.
Despite a few isolated efforts to revive it, the little flute slipped quietly into obscurity.
By the early 20th century, it had vanished.

And yet…

You’ve guessed it: the story doesn’t end there.

A handful of passionate souls —musicians, researchers, the simply curious— set out on a quest.
They reopened the manuscripts, dusted off the flutes, and gave breath once more to a forgotten instrument.

Thanks to their painstaking care, the voices of samurai, monks, hermits, and poets are beginning to resonate again.

Joy.

It is, perhaps, my dearest and wildest dream:
to join that quiet revival, to play my heart out, and let centuries-old notes ripple through today’s soundscape.

I hope, with all my heart, to be part of that dance —
to help rebuild, together, the legacy of these faraway voices.

Because to me, it’s perfectly clear:
despite the passing of time, the song of the hitoyogiri has lost none of its strength—
nor its wisdom.
