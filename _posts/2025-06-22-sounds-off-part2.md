# 🎐 A More Technical Explanation

As we saw [in the previous article](/sounds-off-part1/): despite its simple appearance, the *hitoyogiri* presents a real challenge in terms of intonation, and invites a different kind of listening.

Let me break down the how and why in this follow-up.

---

## 1. A Shorter Flute = Less Stable Pitch

The *hitoyogiri* is shorter than the *shakuhachi* (especially the 1.8 shakuhachi), which means:

- A **shorter air column** → even the slightest change in breath, embouchure, or angle has an immediate and strong effect.
- **Less margin for error**: just a small shift, and you're suddenly too sharp or too flat.

> A longer *shakuhachi* has a **more stable air column**, especially in the lower register, which gives more room to “search” for the note.

---

## 2. Pitch… is Relative

The *hitoyogiri* uses a **non-tempered fingering system**, inherited from an ancient vocal tradition — one that’s closer to singing than to modern instrumental logic. 
As a result:

- Some notes are *intentionally* a little high or low.
- Even with the correct fingerings, you must **compensate with your breath, angle, and mouth shape**.
- In the end, you’re seldom exactly “in tune” in the modern sense — instead, you’re in a **floating, expressive space**.

> And for a modern ear… this can be frustrating.  
> Because it craves **a fixed note**, while the *hitoyogiri*… **sings around it**.

---

## 3. Shakuhachi: Flexible, Yet Centered

- On a good **shakuhachi**, each fingering brings you into a zone of pitch that you can shape using *meri* and *kari* techniques.
- Once your embouchure is well set, you can **feel the center of the note**.
- On the *hitoyogiri*, that center is harder to find — and to hold — especially in the higher register, where everything can spin off quickly.

---

## In Summary:

✅ Yes, the *hitoyogiri* may seem **easier to make a sound on** (thanks to its small size and short distance to the embouchure),  
🚫 but it’s much harder to **keep that sound in tune**.

> It’s an instrument that forgives nothing,  
> but sings in its own way — with fluctuations, inflections, and an **ancient sense of pitch**.

# 🎵 Why It Sounds “Funny” to the Modern Ear

As we’ve seen, on the *hitoyogiri*, covering the right holes isn’t enough.  
You need to **breathe, adjust, listen**.  
The note doesn’t simply appear — it must be shaped.

That’s what makes the sound so **alive**… and also a bit **strange** to modern ears.

---

## 🎼 What If It’s Not “Wrong”… But Ancient?

Our modern idea of “correct pitch” comes from the **tempered scale**, inherited from European classical music.

But the *hitoyogiri* is an **ancient instrument**, from a different culture — and with different references:

- It draws on the **ryō** and **ritsu** scales, found in **gagaku**, the Japanese imperial court music.
- These scales are **not tempered** — they produce intervals that differ significantly from what we’re used to hearing today.

> 🎵 The result:  
> Even if you play “correctly” by *gagaku* standards,  
> **a modern ear may still hear the note as slightly sharp… or flat.**

It’s a bit like listening to bagpipes or Gregorian chant when you’ve grown up on pop and piano:

> It takes a little time to adjust.

# 🌿 An Ancient Flute for a Different Kind of Listening

The *hitoyogiri* is a small, bubbling flute — light-hearted at times,  
capable of lifting the spirit with joyful phrases,  
or quieting the mind with tones that invite focus and reflection.

It asks for patient ears,  
an open heart,  
and a taste for **living imperfection**.

So if you hear a “wrong note” in one of my videos…

> 🎐 …maybe it’s me doing something wrong!  
> …or maybe it’s an echo from ancient Japan, inviting you to travel through time.
