*Since the site isn’t bilingual, I’ve tucked the English version of the welcome page here — a small pocket of Shakespeare’s language for curious travelers. 
Follow the links within the text to wander through the rest of the translations - like the "about" section, my personal bundle and of course the blog.*

Welcome!

This site is for those who see the world a little differently.  
For those who feel deeply, think sideways, and trip over social norms like loose rugs in a busy hallway.  
For those who’ve never quite understood what “living normally” is supposed to mean - yet who still, bravely, try to dance their way through life rather than just think it through.

  Modern-day hermit, contemplative flutist, and image whisperer<br>
I dwell in the hush between drifting clouds and the hum of purring cats.</em></p>


## This little travel journal contains four pages.  
If you’re wondering where to begin, here’s a path through the pages - one that flows gently from why to how, with a treat at the end:

### • [About](/en/about)
Every journey begins with a pause - a quiet moment to check your compass and feel the pull of your own true north.
This is where I share the “why” behind the path I walk.

### • [Bundle](/en/bundle)
What I carry in my backpack as an explorer of the present moment : a handful of anchors to steady me when the winds pick up.

### • [Blog](/tags/#english)
This is my logbook.
Notes from the winding road: stumbles and surprises,
foggy mornings, eddies in the water, stormy nights, and small wonders I don’t want to forget.

### • [Gallery](/fr/galerie)  
You know those strange little treasures tucked away in attics — or dreams?
This is where they whisper.
Welcome to my cabinet of curiosities: images, symbols, fragments of feeling...
each with a story that unfolds when you take the time to listen.
(You may need to lean in, like you’re listening to the sea inside a shell.)
It’s my childhood dream, still alive - just wearing grown-up clothes.
