*(For sensitive souls and fellow sailors in the sea of everyday entropy)*

If I had to keep just one lesson from recent years, it would be this: **travel light**.

It’s taken me years—and a few existential crises—to sift through the countless things I’m passionate about.  
After much sorting, discarding, restarting, and the occasional dramatic sigh, I’ve finally managed to distill the essentials into a small bundle I carry with me wherever I go.

So here it is: my personal kit for navigating existence.  
It’s only mine, of course. But I hope it might inspire you to assemble your own, filled with ingredients only you can choose.

To help you pack yours, I suggest three magical questions *(no wand required)*:

- Does it nourish me… or drain me?  
- Could I live without it for more than a week?  
- Does it give me a sense of wholeness *(or at least that feeling you get when you find a matching pair of socks on a Monday morning)*?


## A Tale of Shakuhachi *(bless you)*

Everyone talks about the importance of breath.  
Very few think to pick up a flute and find out how it actually works.

I play the **shakuhachi**, a Japanese bamboo flute once used by Zen monks in pursuit of spiritual awakening.  
Well, I’m still stuck somewhere between “snooze” and “slow awakening,” but one thing’s certain:  
I’ve never found a better way to check the weather inside myself without triggering a full-blown storm.

Playing the shakuhachi means getting acquainted with your breath. Not the one you *wish* you had, but the one that’s actually there, in the moment.  
It’s like a martial art of self-kindness.

It might sound lofty… but breath rises from deep within us, so why wouldn’t it carry a few truths along the way?

I often struggle to identify what I am really feeling, buried underneath all the “shoulds” and expectations.
The shakuhachi changed that.
I even started a [YouTube channel](#) to talk about it. 
Imagine that.

## A Deck of Cards

So here’s the thing.  
Don’t burn me at the stake, but my method for seing through myself involves… **a Tarot de Marseille**.

Yes, I know.  
And no, I don’t tell the future. I read the *present* and believe me, that’s already enough of an adventure.

I always carry a mini tarot deck in my pocket.  
It’s like a personal translator when I’m lost in the static of daily life.  
It whispers things like, *“You’re feeling anger, not guilt, you know.”*
And I go,*“Ah, I see. Thanks.”*

If you ever struggle to tell the difference between what you think you want and what you actually need given the moment, the tarot can be a surprisingly grounded way to tune in... without losing your mind.
It gives the unconscious a chance to speak its favorite language: images.

## A Pencil for Spontaneous Expression

A pencil might seem like a humble thing.  
But it taught me something essential:  
*when you love doing something, do it for yourself.*

- Not so it will be "well done".  
- Not for validation.  
- Just because it lights up your heart.

A shout-out here to Max, Serge, and Jérôme, each of whom, in their own way, helped me recognise the beauty of raw, unfiltered aliveness.

## Silence at the Bottom of Your Pockets

If you’re anything like me, your pockets probably hold a stone, a shell, or a scrap of bark picked up on a walk.  
Maybe even a book, if your pockets are particularly ambitious.

These samll objects have a quiet but powerful gift: **they bring us back to ourselves through touch**.

Over time, my bundle has evolved into a kind of **anchoring toolkit**.  
These days, I never leave home without my survival kit:

- noise-cancelling headphones  
- tinted glasses  
- a scarf  
- and a beanie or hat

Simple gear to soften sensory overload and build a little cocoon, even in the middle of chaos.

At first, it was a semi-conscious defence mechanism.  
But eventually, I realised how much these objects helped me...and how vulnerable I felt without them.

Maybe you’ve got a few of your own, without even realising it.  
Come to think of it… **have you ever asked yourself?**
