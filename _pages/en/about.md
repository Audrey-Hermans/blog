For the longest time, I felt like I’d somehow missed out on life’s instruction manual.
*You know*, the one everyone else supposedly receives at birth.
People around me seemed to stride forward with purpose, like they knew the rules of the game.
Me? I was always trailing behind, rifling through empty pockets for a key that didn’t exist,
but that everyone else appeared to have.

I live in a world that’s too loud, too bright, too fast… *just too much*.
So I fake comprehension, just enough to blend in.
The result? A slow drowning in murky emotional waters, topped off with a dollop of mental overload.

Eventually, after gulping down enough metaphorical water, I had a revelation.  
No divine lightning bolt. No angels singing.  
Just a fleeting, lifesaving brainwave:  
> “Too much. The problem is there’s just too much. You’re overflowing.”

Sometimes, you just have to stop piling things on.  
Not just around you — _within_ you, too. Especially within.  
And that’s when things started to shift.  
Not overnight, of course. But gradually. Steadily.

It’s a winding path, full of stumbles and steep climbs.  
Truth be told, I often get dizzy, but I promise, the journey is worth it. The views can be breathtaking.

This website is a collection of glimpses from that path, little postcards from the trail that I'd like to share with you.  
No promises of enlightenment or miracle fixes (I’ll leave those to the self-declared gurus).  
If anything, think of me as the broom wagon at the back of the pack,  
offering a bottle of water and maybe an ice cream cone to fellow travelers catching their breath on the roadside.

We move together, at our own pace, while the others race ahead.  
We cheer each other on — because deep down, we’re all walking in the same direction.

## Before we set off, let's gather what we need!

Here’s what’s in my bundle:

- my flute, to listen to my breath   
- and a pencil, always ready to shape whatever inspiration shows up

[Meet me on the bundle page](/en/bundle/) — I’ll show you how I pack my bag to travel light, without leaving behind what truly matters.
